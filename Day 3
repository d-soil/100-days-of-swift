##Arithmetic Operations:
Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Modulo: %

##Operator Overloading:
Arrays, integers and strings can be joined (to themselves) with +'s

##Compound Assignment Operators
Shorthand operators like +=, -=, *=, /= work

##Comparison Operators
Is equal to: ==
Is not equal to: !=

Greater than: >
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than: <
Less than or equal to: <=

##Conditionals
if x == 1 {
    print("X is 1")
} else if x == 2 {
    print("X is 2")
} else {
    print("X could be anything except 1 or 2")
}

##Combining Conditions:
Logical AND operator: &&
Logical OR operator: ||

##Ternary Operator:
A fun little shorthand if statement
print(x == y ? "String if true" : "String if false")

##Switch Statements
Switch statements are better than a bunch of complicated if else ifs
switch weather {
    case "rain":
        print("It is raining")
    case "snow":
        print("It is snowing")
    case "sunny":
        print("It is sunny")
        fallthrough
    default:
        print("Enjoy your day!")
}
If you want to run the code from multiple cases, you can use the 'fallthrough' as seen above.

##Range Operators:
Half-open range operator: ..<
eg. 1..<5 == 1, 2, 3, 4
Closed range operator: ...
eg. 1...5 == 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
