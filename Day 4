// Day 4
##For Loops:
let count = 1...10
for number in count {
    print("Number is \(number)")
}
You could do the same thing with a standard array

You can also use an underscore 
for _ in 1...5{
    print("Play")
}

##While Loops:
var number = 1
while number <= 20 {
    print(number)
    number += 1
}

##Repeat Loops:
Similar to a while loop except the condition is checked AFTER performing the first loop
var number = 1
repeat {
    print(number)
    number += 1
} while number <= 20

##Breaking Loops:
Use keyword 'break' to get out of a loop without meeting the normal exit requirements

##Exiting Multiple Loops:
outerLoop: for i in 1...10 {
    for j in 1...10 {
        let product = i * j
        print("\(i) * \(j) is \(product)")

        if product == 50 {
            print("Lets get out of here")
            break outerLoop
        }
    }
}
A regular break would only exit the inner loop, whereas using break outerLoop both loops are exited at the same time.

##Skipping Items:
for i in 1...10 {
    if i % 2 == 1 {
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
This code will skip odd numbers but continue through the loop to print the even numbers.

##Infinite Loops:
Infinite loops need break conditions or they will keep looping forever (hence infinite), not recommended.
while true {
    break
}
